# Yet Another Javascript Json Schema Library (...hehe)


### Goals of this Library

1. To provide type validation for enities inside a json object
2. To provide value validation for entities inside a json object
3. The output of this will either be a list of error messages or a monadic type holding the validated key-pairs

### Development Goals

1. Use Monads and it's related operations  to make for readable code
2. Use Ramda.js for other other operations
3. Test library thoroughly
